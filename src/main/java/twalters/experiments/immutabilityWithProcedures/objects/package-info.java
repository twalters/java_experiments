/**
 * Contains the immutable objects that will store data and state for the application. Objects should be able to clone
 * with a way to change the parameters in the cloning process (likely a Builder, at least for objects with more than
 * 3 parameters). All the objects should also implement the hash code and equals methods. Depending on the type of
 * data being stored, lists may or may not need to be in a certain order for equals.
